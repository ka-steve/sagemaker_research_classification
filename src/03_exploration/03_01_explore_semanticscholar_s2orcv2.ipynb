       "0  \\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe diaphragm is formed from a number of composite origins in the embryo. The most important is the \"septum transversum\", which is a thick mass of cranial mesenchyme that gives rise to parts of the thoracic diaphragm. Without dwelling into more details, the septum transversum merges with mesoderm surrounding the esophagus, the growing pleura and peritoneum ('pleuroperitoneal folds') and the growing muscles of the abdominal wall. The septum transversum gives rise to the cent...   \n",

Adequate use of organomineral fertilizers (OMF) through nitrogen-fixing microorganisms is necessary to solve this problem. By creating an optimal nutrient environment for nitrogen-fixing microorganisms. it is important to research in the direction of achieving the process of maximum nitrogen fixation in the air and creating a flexibl...   \n",

       "6  \\nIntroduction\\n\\nAging and age-related disorders have emerged as significant medical and social concerns. Extensive research has indicated that the aging process is influenced by a complex interplay of various factors, including genetic and epigenetic interactions (Campisi et al., 2019;López-Otín et al., 2023). Aging is characterized by a decrease in various physiological activities of the organism and is accompanied by changes in the internal and external environment of the organism. Senes...   \n",

Between 2000 and 2015, Asian immigrant populations in the United States grew faster than any other migrant group (Zong and Batalova 2016). This increase has stimulated a growing number of researchers to focus on Asian immigrants although research on Latino migrant populations is still dominating the field of migration studies in the United States, especially when...   \n",

This protocol involves the administration of exogenous estrogen and progesterone trying to mimic the hormonal changes happening physiologically in a natural cycle. \\n\\nWhereas the number of days of progesterone administration until the embryo transfer (ET) is clearly defined according to the embryo development stage, the...   \n",
       "9  \\nIntroduction\\n\\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth most common malignant cancer in the world. Approximately 250 000 people worldwide die of HCC each year [1,2] . More than 60% of patients who suffer from HCC are not diagnosed at an early stage because of the unclear pathogenesis of the disease, a hallmark of HCC. A delayed diagnosis of HCC results in only a 5% survival rate after 5 years [3] . Most cancer-associated mortality is related to the metastasis of malignant cancer cells...   \n",

Individual components of well-detached binary systems are assumed to be two single-like stars with a common origin, i.e. they share the same chemical composition and same age. Therefore, one expects to fit the observed parameters of both components with a single isochrone at the same metallicity.

Catalog of Clusters (Sources) of Gamma-ray Bursts    The clusters of gamma-ray bursts are considered which are assumed to be images of the repeated gamma-ray burst (GRB) sources. It is shown, that localization of the cosmic gamma-ray burst sources (GBS) is determined by the clusters of GRBs. About 100 candidates in sources are presented in the form of the catalog, which is compiled relying on the base of the BATSE data up to middle of 2000. Gamma-ray bursts (from 5 to 13) of a cluster that display a source do not coincide in their position. ...                        <NA>\n",

Although the above pipeline, which we refer to as pruning + fine-tuning, has been extremely successful in lowering the complexity of trained models, there is very little known about the theory behind this success. ...
