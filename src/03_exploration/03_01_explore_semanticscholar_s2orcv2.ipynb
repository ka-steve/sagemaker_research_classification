From planetesimals, protoplanets, or planetary embryos, form through a process of runaway and oligarchic growth (e.g., Kokubo &amp; Ida 1998.

       "In the standard scenario of planet formation, planetesimals are the building blocks of planets (e.g., Safronov 1969;Hayashi et al. 1985). In a protoplanetary disk, small dust grains grow to kilometer-sized objects called planetesimals. From planetesimals, protoplanets, or planetary embryos, form through a process of runaway and oligarchic growth (e.g., Kokubo & Ida 1998. However, the formation mechanism of planetesimals is one of today's most important unsolved probl...   \n",

       "Deep learning models are typically trained offline to produce models with a static allocation of compute and memory resource. However, the conditions in real-world setting are often different, whereby the runtime inference is neither optimal from an accuracy or efficiency perspective. The problem lies in the current training approaches that produce static models that occupy a single point in the trade-space between performance and resource use. This paper presents an...   \n",

       "Facial paralysis is a severe complication of vestibular schwannoma (VS) surgery and signi cantly impacts quality of life. Hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis is one of the most effective methods for facial paralysis treatment after VS surgery [1][2][3][4][5][6]. However, classic hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis involves complete hypoglossal nerve transection, which leads to speech, masticatory and swallowing dysfunctions [7][8][9][10].

       "Prostaglandins were first discovered and isolated from human semen in the 1930s by Ulf Von Euler of Sweden. Thinking they had come from the prostrate gland, he named them Prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are like hormones in that they act as chemical messengers, but do not move to other sites, but work right within the cells where they are synthesized (Ophardt, 2003). Von Euler (1937) also stated that biologically active lipids in human seminal plasma were first detect...   \n",

Nevertheless we have to deal previously with phase unwrapping problem as a vital step in log-spectral averaging and a long-standing problem in homomorphic deconvolution (Oppenheim et al., 1976;Lines, 1976;Tribolet, 1977).
